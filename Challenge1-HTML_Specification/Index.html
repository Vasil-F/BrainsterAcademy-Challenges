        <h2>iPad</h2>
        <p>
          The iPad is a brand of iOS and iPadOS-based tablet computers that are
          developed by Apple Inc. The iPad was conceived before the related
          iPhone but the iPhone was developed and released first. Speculation
          about the development, operating system, and release of the original
          iPad began in 2002 prior to its introduction on January 20, 2010. The
          iPad range consists of the original iPad lineup and the flagship
          products iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro.The iPhone's iOS operating
          system (OS) was initially used for the iPad but in September 2019, its
          OS was switched to a fork of iOS called iPadOS that has better support
          for the device's hardware and its user interface is customized for the
          tablets' larger screens. The iPad's App Store is subject to
          application and content approval.

        <h2>iPhone X</h2>
        <p>
          The iPhone X used a glass and stainless-steel form factor and
          "bezel-less" design, shrinking the bezels while not having a "chin",
          unlike many Android phones. It was the first iPhone to use an OLED
          screen. The home button's fingerprint sensor was replaced with a new
          type of authentication called Face ID, which used sensors to scan the
          user's face to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability
          also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression
          (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed
          significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather
          than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its
          November 2017 launch, its price tag of US$999 also made it the most
          expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to
          additional local sales and import taxes.

          <h2>MacBookAir</h2>
          <p>
            The MacBook Air is a line of notebook computers developed and
            manufactured by Apple Inc. It consists of a full-size keyboard, a
            machined aluminum case, and, in the more modern versions, a thin light
            structure. The Air was originally positioned above the previous
            MacBook line as a premium ultraportable.[2] Since then, the original
            MacBook's discontinuation in 2011, and lowered prices on subsequent
            iterations, have made the Air Apple's entry-level notebook.[3] In the
            current product line, the MacBook Air is situated below the
            performance range MacBook Pro. The Intel-based MacBook Air was
            introduced in January 2008 with a 13.3-inch screen, and was promoted
            as the world's thinnest notebook, opening a laptop category known as
            the ultrabook family.
